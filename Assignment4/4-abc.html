    <h1>Online Classes Benifits</h1>
    <h3 id="a1">1. Scheduling Flexibility</h3>
    <p>For many learners, the primary benefit of online learning involves scheduling flexibility. Some programs allow degree- and certificate-seekers to start a course immediately. In other cases, students can select between a traditional 16-week course and an accelerated eight-week course. This page highlights accelerated courses' advantages in a later section.
    <br>
        Although many online courses run asynchronously to provide maximum scheduling flexibility, some require learners to collaborate with peers at set times or meet with a professor during virtual office hours. Prospective students should research these requirements before signing up for an online course</p>
        
    <h3 id="a2">2. Lower Total Costs</h3>
        <p>Many prospective students overlook the cost advantages of online classes. Although online learners may pay the same per-credit tuition rate as on-campus degree- and certificate-seekers, they do not pay for on-campus housing or meal plans. Learners also save time and money by eliminating a commute.
        <br>
            Other cost savings include cheaper textbooks, especially if online learners can purchase digital versions. As long as online learners take enough credits to qualify as part-time students, they can apply for federal financial aid programs, such as grants and loans. Most colleges also allow online degree- and certificate-seekers to apply for institutional aid, including need-based grants and merit-based scholarships.</p>
        
    <h3 id="a3">3. More Comfortable Learning Environment</h3>
    <p>With the ability to study anywhere, online learners can complete coursework at home, a coffee shop, or a library. This advantage of online learning allows students to work in the environment that best suits them. As new online degree- and certificate-seekers research different places, they should focus on those that offer a reliable internet connection and few distractions. Another factor to consider is space requirements, as some facilities' tables may lack the space for a computer and reference materials.</p>
    
    <h3 id="a4">4. Pacing Options</h3>
    <p>Before taking an online course, learners should understand three terms that can define the online learning experience. The first term, asynchronous, refers to a course that does not hold scheduled meetings. Students complete work at convenient times but must still meet assignment deadlines.
    <br>
        The second term, synchronous, describes the opposite of asynchronous. Like on-campus courses, synchronous online courses maintain set meeting times where the professor instructs learners over Zoom or another video conferencing service.
    <br>    
        Lastly, accelerated refers to courses that last fewer than 16 weeks. Accelerated courses post the same academic requirements and work best for learners with no external work or family obligations.</p>

    <h3 id="a5">5. Geographic Flexibility</h3>
    <p>Another advantage of online education that relates to flexibility involves prospective students' geographic location. Many of the nation's top colleges and universities offer online degrees and certificates, meaning that learners do not have to relocate to attend a premier school. They do not incur moving expenses since they can study from any location. This flexibility also saves money, as the cost of living among different cities can vary greatly.
    <br>
        Besides saving money, not needing to move means that degree- and certificate-seekers do not need to end friendships and professional relationships. They can also live closer to extended family members. These advantages of online classes can lead to greater emotional well-being and less stress.</p>

    <h3 id="a6">6. Career Advancement</h3>
        <p>Nontraditional learners enjoy two significant advantages of online classes related to career advancement. First, a certificate or degree can qualify an employee for a raise. Second, some companies restrict management-level positions to employees who possess a bachelor's or master's degree. Earning a degree can lead to a promotion that may also involve increased wages.
        <br>
            Besides tangible career benefits, most online degrees and certificates also allow learners to continue working while they study. Students can work during the day and complete coursework in the evenings or on the weekends. Additionally, learners who work can apply new knowledge and skills to their job immediately.</p>

     <h3 id="a7">7. Improve Your Technical Skills</h3>
     <p>Learning online can help students hone the technical skills they need on the job. New skills can include the ability to use new software suites, perform in-depth research online, and communicate effectively online in various formats such as discussion boards and teleconferencing. Employers often demand these skills as more and more positions require employees to work remotely. Students can also add new skills to a resume and discuss them during a job interview.</p>
