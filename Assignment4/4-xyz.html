   <h2 id="s1">1.Life In The Trees</h2>
   <p>“What did you want to do? Like, in general I mean.”

    This is the first thing either boy had said in about an hour and a half. Approximately forty-five minutes had been taken up sharing a cold can of beans in the Dulchet’s tree fort. Both the treehouse and the beans were free for the taking, now that Mr. and Mrs. Dulchet had passed away. Waylon and Matthew passed back and forth the can of beans between them in complete silence, in the kind quiet contemplation something as utilitarian as beans usually demands. Matthew had been the first to break the silence.
    
    “What, when I grew up or something?” said Waylon.
    
    Matthew nodded. Waylon was the older of the two, exotically adult at the age of seventeen, at least in comparison to Matthew. The two years of difference between them was a chasm of time, with so much potential for change. It didn’t really make a difference anymore, though. Matthew was just desperate for any conversation that didn’t revolve around the current situation they found themselves in, the situation that presumably, every single person on Earth also found themselves in. They couldn’t tell. The television had been reduced to a single channel, an emergency alert screen, telling them what they already knew. Life as they knew it was over. The television called it ‘civil unrest’, after the American government had told its people that the mute, ravenous citizens with decomposing flesh roaming the streets were actually pro-Communist dissenters. As a result, many Americans hugged them in direct defiance of public advice, believing it to be a hoax.
    
    At any rate, it was the majority of what Waylon and Matthew had talked about for about six months. They didn’t have much else in common other than survival. Matthew played French horn and had never kissed a girl. Waylon’s father ran a real estate company and he always had money, and, remarkably, a rather impressive beard for a seventeen year-old. Trying not to die tied them together, and not much else.
    
    Waylon thought about the question for a moment.
    
    “Shit, I guess I just assumed I would work for my dad. I wasn’t really thinking about it too much. I wanted to do the whole back-packing crap for a year, just like… you know. Go somewhere where I can have a beer and I don’t need to drink it out of the back of the bleachers like some kind of ghoul,” he said.
    
    “I guess you can do that now,” Matthew said.
    
    “I do do that now, but it’s always warm, you know? It’s July, I should have a cold beer in one hand,” he said, splaying out his hand for effect, “and my other hand is halfway down Aislinn Parker’s underpants.”
    
    Matthew laughed.
    
    “Gross, dude,” he said.
    
    “What?” Waylon said, “She’s cute.”
    
    “What if you mixed up your hands?”
    
    Waylon smirked, and said, “Even better.”
    
    The two boys allowed themselves the indulgence of a chuckle about that idea. Their laughs faded, and reality settled over the treehouse again. 
    
    It was after two, maybe three in the afternoon. This time of year, it was hard to tell, but it wasn’t the same sharp heat from a few hours ago, when they had climbed into the treehouse. A cool breeze rippled through the empty frame near the west wall, the hole meant to suggest a window. With all the money the Dulchets had, you’d think they could have sprung for an actual window, but they’d been old, and had built the treehouse in the 80s, when their own children were young. The effect, however, of the open air, was not ideal for relaxing, eating, or even talking. A faded opera of moans and that weird barking sound those things made punctuated the call of birds, blissfully ignorant. It was exhausting.
    
    “God, I hate them,” Waylon sighed. 
    
    “Haha, yeah,” Matthew said, instantly regretting his own tone. He had noticed that over the last four months, after both of their families had made the unwise decision to walk, open-armed and smiling, into swarms of wailing undead, that he tended to be a little sycophantic with Waylon. Matthew was desperate to impress him, sometimes fabricating stories about girls, or about heroic fistfights over nothing. They had met while looting in a CVS. Oblivious to Matthew’s apparent misstep, Waylon said:
    
    “What about you?”
    
    “Huh?”
    
    “What did you want to be? When you ‘grew up’, or whatever,” Waylon explained.
    
    “Oh, that,” Matthew said.
    
    What Matthew really wanted was to become Waylon. Not take over his life completely, that would be weird. But he did want that kind of seemingly effortless life, the one where things seemed to just come to you; your birthright would be delivered as if in the mail, faithfully and constantly. He wanted a girlfriend, although he wasn’t really sure what to do after he got one. He wanted also the option to backpack around somewhere if only to fulfil a vapid desire to drink a cold beer somewhere without anyone getting mad at you. What he didn’t want was to become like his family, trashy and aimless, bound by a gambler’s fallacy in every aspect of their lives - their weights, their money, actual gambling - and spending his prime years desperately aching for things to fall into place.
    
    “Lawyer? I don’t know. I guess I didn’t think about it much, either,” he said.
    
    “God, don’t do that,” Waylon said, “My brother does that. That guy is a goddamn mess.”
    
    “Still?”
    
    “Oh! Yeah, I guess not.”
    
    “Also, I mean, I guess I can’t really become a lawyer right now anyway,” Matthew said.
    
    “No, no, think about it,” Waylon said, “You represent people who raided the pharmacy, who are getting sued by other people who wanted to raid the pharmacy but they showed up a few hours too late and now they’re mad.”
    
    Matthew broke out laughing. He didn’t even notice how squeaky he sounded.
    
    “Seriously! Think about it! ‘Wah, I wanted Tampax and laxatives,’ and then you’re like, objection, your honor! And the judge is like, eleven years old, so he’s like, ‘sustained!’ and then everyone just goes home,” Waylon continued.
    
    Matthew wiped tears from his eyes. He was no longer laughing, per say, but hiccupping and gasping for air. He grasped weakly in front of him.
    
    Waylon hurled the empty can of beans outside of the window, hitting one of the larger, hulking undead in the eye. It was incensed and impotent in its rage.
    
    “Maybe I shouldn’t have done that,” Waylon said.
    
    Matthew took a deep breath, still recovering from laughter.
    
    “Oh,” he said, “Who even cares anymore.”
    
    They had both, at one point or another, remarked on the general uselessness of trying during a time like this. The odds were stacked and sometimes it seemed wiser to succumb. Maybe those people who had walked into the sea of the dead had the right idea - get it over with, submit to the bloodshed, rather than waiting, waiting, waiting. The push against the seeming inevitability of being bitten, consumed, it neared the province of idiocy. There were just so very many of them. Maybe there was no shame in being outnumbered.
    
    There is, however, a feeling inside nearly everyone, a feeling that tells them that they are exceptional, special, worthy of praise. Nearly everyone (with a few, healthy exceptions) walks around with the same thought, that there is a small spark of the divine inside them, a pearl of singular authenticity that other people simply do not possess. This is no accident. Why, if you didn’t believe this, would you make serious efforts to save your own life when it was threatened? Why would you submit to diets, or opinion, or washing your own hair? The drive to live is rooted in the idea - whether false or universal is up to debate - that one is special. Matthew had thought about this frequently since meeting Waylon, although he would also make special efforts to save Waylon, perhaps even at the risk of his own life. If one of them was going to survive, Matthew thought, it should be him. Despite his intense envy about Waylon’s life, looks, and money (a thing that didn’t really matter anymore), the reason for this was simple: his own specialness (which he questioned, sometimes) was meaningless without Waylon. A tree falling in the forest. He couldn’t bear it.
    
    An hour passed, in silence. Both of them had become skilled at allowing a certain amount of time to pass without saying anything at all, if not because time had lost a lot of its meaning but at least because the knowing you weren’t alone was enough to suffocate the anxiety that drives small talk. 
    
    “I guess we’re staying here,” Waylon said suddenly, piercing the silence.
    
    “Oh,” Matthew said, “Yeah, I mean. Unless you wanted to…”
    
    “Jesus, no. God. I can’t stand doing that again. I want like, one day, you know? Just a single day where I don’t have to sit in a tree, or eat something out of a can, or look at one of those things and then shoot it, ‘cause, I don’t know. God, do you remember last week?”
    
    Matthew did remember last week. Waylon had been forced to shoot the rotting, lumbering body of Mr. Ogilvie, his chemistry teacher. They had gotten along well, before.
    
    “I hate knowing they were people, you know?” he continued, “I don’t get to feel like it’s good versus evil, me and you against everyone else. It’s just you and me, versus something really shitty that happened to everyone we used to know.”
    
    He paused for a second and slapped the floor of the treehouse, startling Matthew.
    
    “Do you want a beer?” Waylon said, his face slightly manic.
    
    “A hot beer,” Matthew said, “Mmm.”
    
    “Suit yourself.”
    
    “No, no, I do. Sorry. I was just being a dick,” Matthew said.
    
    “No, I’m sorry.”
    
    Matthew gave him a thumbs-up, which was part of their private language. This gesture meant, ‘whatever you just did, which was weird or angry or scary or mean, is okay, because I get it, because I also feel bad’. This simple transaction always calmed the other one down. Waylon handed Matthew his beer which was, as promised, a little hot. 
    
    “Oh, damn. Did you remember the pillows?” Waylon said.
    
    Matthew scrambled onto the other side of the treehouse and zipped open the duffel bag he carried everywhere. The two ‘pillows’, lumpy bags of cotton chosen for their extreme portability and vague resemblance to real pillows, were there. He held one up, and they both sighed in relief.
    
    “I don’t want to have to do the pretzel again,” Waylon said, sipping his beer.
    
    ‘The pretzel’ was an uncomfortable sleeping position they adopted about two months ago, where they both used the other one’s calves as an ersatz pillow. It was deeply uncomfortable and totally unsustainable, as they would both wake up with their necks craned onto whatever surface they’d fallen asleep on. After the incident where they broke into Carol Burrough’s house and tried to sleep on her improbably large waterbed, and had to spend a good four hours fighting off undead intruders, they opted for safer places to lay their heads for the night, which were almost always incredibly disagreeable for sleeping. The Dulchet’s treehouse was no exception. 
    
    They sipped in silence, tossing their empty beer cans out the window into the now-swelling crowd of the undead. They could not climb ladders, but the boys had folded up the roped steps just in case, for insurance. Every so often, one of them would say something. Once or twice, it was about ‘now’, the terrifying sadness that would, as far as they could surmise, would last until their deaths, whenever that would be. That day, though, until they fell asleep, they talked about things that didn’t matter much at all, even before. 
    
    They both laid down at about ten, while the sun set. Waylon fell asleep in the corner, curled into himself like a large shrimp, while Matthew stared out the squared out space in the west end of the treehouse, thinking about nothing until he, too, fell asleep.</p>

    <h2 id="s2">2.My Mother's Sky</h2>
    <p>You sip on hot lemon and honey. The steam rolls out of the cup like a vertical carpet. It covers your nose and fogs your view of the peeling rosebud wallpaper over the sink. There are grocery store flowers on the scrubbed, scratched table, and a curling piece of paper with your mother's words scrawled across it in black pen, all caps. Her instructions, which include drinking this mugful, feeding the dog, and bringing in the mail are written in English. Anything that has to do with loving you is in Spanish.

        Mi cielo, she calls you. My sky.
        
        You cough violently into the crook of your elbow and sit at the edge of the table. It is morning and it is March in San Bernadino. Bright green tendrils of crawling leaves press against the kitchen window and the sky is the color of dust in light as you make neat folds in the edges of your mother's note. Your throat is a raw, tender patch of heat, as if the High Desert region has parasitically stitched itself inside you in hopes you will never go, never leave it. So you swallow again, tangy lemon and smooth honey. Heat joins heat. You fight fire with fire.
        
        You stand. The dog finds you, its nails sounding on the linoleum in crisp, quick clacks. You bend at the waist and ruffle its ears. Its pink tongue lolls. You kiss her forehead and then rinse out your mug. You set the Dollar Store porcelain in the sink, resolving to wash it sometime between a few television shows and your mother's return.
        
        The strip of carpet that runs to your bedroom does not send chills through the naked soles of your feet like the linoleum did, and for that, you are grateful. You pad to your room in the back of the house where the blankets on your bed remain mangled and waiting for you to cocoon beneath them again. Your Class of 2011 sweatshirt is crumpled on the floor. You tug open your closet door and select a pair of sandals. The dog follows you.
        
        You flip flop to the concrete patio out back and tear open the lid on a can of wet dog food. You bang on the butt of the can until a soft, brown cylinder plops into the bowl. As per routine, your dog's eyes rest on the food with ravenous intent, but obeys when you nudge her with your knee, the one that still needs surgery, and say, "Oración." Prayer.
        
        She drops to her belly and buries her head between her paws.
        
        "Gracias, Señor, y bendícenos estos alimentos que vamos a recibir de tu generosidad por Cristo Nuestro Señor. Amén."
        
        At "amen," your dog pounces the bowl.
        
        As a child, you sometimes said the prayer and postponed the amén, fascinated by the sight of your pup struggling somewhere between obedience and desire. Her eyes would twitch upward at the pause, and you'd laugh. You are ashamed of this, but a part of you even enjoyed knowing you held the power to keep a creature smaller than you trapped by your silence until one day you realized you felt so much like her, shaking with anticipation for the right to seize all that waited for you. For the first time, you heard the notes of cruelty in your laughter. You lost heart in the joke.
        
        You slip through the slapping screen door and walk through the kitchen, the living room, and out the front door. You cough again. You open the tin top of the mailbox attached to the side of the house, right below the address numbers.
        
        Vaguely curious, you file through the mail. There are bills. A flier for the car dealership on the east end. A birthday card from Tía Alejandra. An envelope from Seattle University.
        
        An envelope from Seattle University.
        
        You begin to shake then. Your foot is poised over the threshold of the doorway, and the door smacks your shoulder. The dog barks at the back door, but she sounds as far away as memories of your father, as far away as the stars. You stare at the official insignia printed in the left-hand corner of the envelope and at your name in the center until it is blurry enough to be anyone else's.
        
        Something sharp and alive drives through you until you are blinking at the ceiling and gasping for air, smiling and terribly afraid. You wring out your hands because you feel like you should and you pace for a moment before striding to the table that held your elbows just moments ago. You drop the rest of the mail by your mother's note and pace again because a chair cannot hold you. Your heart is a balloon round with whistling lightness, so full and fragile.
        
        You hold the edge of the table and stare at the envelope there, rectangular and thick. You turn it over and stare at its sealed belly and press your fingernail beneath the fold. All the pictures you've seen of Seattle contain an ocean that is geographically the same, but quite unlike your own: brooding and grey, tracing the edge of the city in frothing white when the storms come through. There will be something comforting about a sick day in Seattle, you think; the sun will not always be in your eyes, the cobalt streets will cradle you, you will watch the world from a window up high. The fog will heal you, remind you of the steam of hot lemon and honey. And perhaps when you come home, you will be able to ask your mother whether she can see how new you are. You will build something there, something totally your own, and one day your mother will have a dishwasher.
        
        Everything in you longs to rip the seam of the envelope because everything in you wants to know what tomorrow means. But your mother calls you mi cielo, and she is not there. So you wait for her return. You wait for her amén.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="s3">3.Shooting for the Stars</h2>
        <p>It’s Friday, which means you’re sitting on the rooftop of your squat, boxy apartment building. It’s nighttime, so of course you’re joined by a silver stream of distant glittering stars and your also silvery, also glittering machine gun.

            Nova puts every other so-called “machine gun” to shame, and even thinking about the disgraces you’d see in movies and the military causes your nose to wrinkle in distaste. All those dull grays and greens?
            
            You click your tongue and run a gentle hand over Nova. Guns like these are meant to stand out, not blend into the dirt and dusty ground.
            
            But you know better than to go raving to your friends about how beautiful Nova is, because oh right, Nova is a machine gun mounted to the roof of your apartment building. Best case scenario, you’d be met with some concerned looks and a recommendation to your buddy’s therapist. Worst case, you’d find yourself opening your front door to the police. 
            
            So save for Mr. Holmes, the elderly landlord, who, like you, has a small constellation tattoo just under his left collarbone, there weren’t that many people you could complain to.
            
            He’d had his own Estelle after all. Every few weeks or so, you’d get together in the little back office with a bottle of cheap wine and rant (well, you’d rant, Holmes would listen) about how no one else could possibly understand.
            
            You look back up at those pinpoints of light, so impossibly high up above, twinkling in brazen display. As if they had not a single worry in the world.
            
            You shake your head. No prey on earth would prance about so bravely, but you’d always figured the celestial realm never got the memo.
            
            You have a good feeling about tonight. Tonight, you’d show those stars that they should be worried. 
            
            You make certain to murmur extra praise to Nova, and in smooth, practiced motions, adjust her tripod so she points right up towards the darkened sky.
            
            Once locked into position, Nova begins to wake up. 
            
            This was always your favorite part, because if Nova was stunning before, now she’s quite literally awe-inspiring. The first time you’d seen an astral armament in action, your aunt’s Cassiopeia, you had cried. Granted, you were eight years old then, and you aren’t crying now, but that wide-eyed wonder is still the same. The fizzy excitement in your veins, the lightness in your lungs, the smile that inevitably drifts onto your face. 
            
            The intricate, geometric patterns etched into Nova’s exterior start to fill with what you can only describe as a deep, abyssal sort of light, shifting navy, black, purple. Iridescence on a crow’s wing. 
            
            Then Nova expands, previously invisible seams on her metal body widening, silvery panels gliding apart and outwards with a gentle click, revealing a center of… 
            
            Well, even looking straight at it, you’re not exactly sure what the center is, but it reminds you of those NASA pictures, the ones with the giant pillars of gas that where old elements collapse into new stars. It’s beautiful, a storm cloud that flickers from within, pulsing with a dark radiance. 
            
            The metal panels settle into position, rotating mid-air to orbit gently around Nova’s core, Jupiter and all its moons.
            
            Once a deep resonant humming fills the air, settles into your chest, you know Nova's ready, and go to load it.
            
            That's the other thing. 
            
            Most machine guns spit metal bullets, rain down hellfire and shrapnel. But hellfire and shrapnel does little but splatter human flesh across the ground.
            
            So tasteless. And moreover, so incredibly useless.
            
            Nova’s different.
            
            She does shoot (she's an astral armament after all, and a damn good one at that) but instead of clicking a cartridge into her, you pull out a small box from your pocket, made out of the same bright and shimmering material.
            
            You’d seen your aunt’s bullet case too, and before you had any idea what she did, you had long wondered why she kept a featureless block of metal sitting on her shelf. Every time she caught you staring at it, she’d laugh and give it to you, asking if you could open it for her.
            
            Then she’d walk out of the room, and of course, you never could quite get the thing open. One summer day, over a year since she’d first put the case in your hands, you had run out onto the driveway, and with all the force in your tiny body, slammed it against the pavement.
            
            Nothing. The thing wasn’t even scratched.
            
            Perhaps you had then collapsed onto the ground in a fit of frustrated tears.
            
            You’d later find out your aunt had been watching you from the ground floor window, doubled over in hysterical laughter. 
            
            The answer didn’t come until she went out to the driveway and took you, still sniffling, into the innocuous shed that sat in her backyard. There you were met with a bronze leviathan of a machine gun, polished until the surface shone like it was encased in diamond.
            
            Say hello to Cassiopeia, she had said.
            
            Years later, you take a step closer, a slightly different metal box in hand, and extend it towards Nova.
            
            Immediately, the surface begins to change, those same geometric patterns that decorated Nova etching themselves into the case.
            
            It had taken a bit of time to memorize, but now your hand moves automatically, tracing the designs. First the circles that represents Terra and Luna, then the arcs of the Kuiper belt, then Polaris, Sirius, and Rigel.
            
            The top of the box separates, and with a ginger grip, you remove the newly formed lid. Even if someone else had managed to open the case, you’d always figured they’d be sorely disappointed by what they found inside. There were no gold ingots or cut rubies nested in the red velvet interior, only what appeared to be a bunch of glass beads.
            
            But of course, most people didn't have a Nova, Cassiopeia, or Estelle sitting nearby. Most people would never see how those glass beads would glow like miniature galaxies when fed into the swirling cores of an astral armament.
            
            Finally, you're ready.
            
            You line your eye up through the sight, and take aim at a particularly bright star in the northeast quadrant of the sky.
            
            You take a deep breath.
            
            Squeeze the trigger.
            
            The bead streaks into the night, trailing sparks and a black light like no other.
            
            Then comes the kickback, slow and forceful, an emanating pressure wave. You grind your feet into the concrete in an attempt to stay upright but get bowled over anyways.
            
            Though you must admit, as you lay there with your back flat on the ground, you have a brilliant vantage point of the single bullet that shoots into the ether above.
            
            You watch, eyes sharp and hungry.
            
            And then you see it.
            
            It hits. 
            
            Your pulse conveniently disappears for a moment, then returns with a vengeance, and for a couple seconds, you can’t quite figure out how to get air into your lungs. Maybe you shouldn't be this surprised, but you'd never actual managed to hook an actual star before.
            
            You'd reeled in plenty of comets, asteroids, and more meteorites than you could count, the typical hunks of rock, ice, and metal. Once, you'd gotten lucky with Saturn passing overhead and managed to take back a tiny chunk of its rings. That had sold for a very pretty price, likely to made into an inimitable piece of jewelry hanging around some big shot’s neck, one that would make the terrestrials gasp at its hypnotic sparkle and the empyreans glare in envy.
            
            But this? 
            
            This is different. This is what every star hunter dreamed for at night.
            
            This is a star.
            
            In fact, you're so wonderstruck that you forget that the star is falling very quickly, and falling very quickly towards you.
            
            It isn't until the star breaches the atmosphere in a flash of orange light that you realize that you're about to be baked like a calzone if you don't start moving right this instant. You scramble to your feet, dump down an entire box of light-absorbing mats, raise your heat shields into a very crooked ring, and thank the lord that Old Man Holmes had built a makeshift shelter for when he'd been right where you are, hunting stars himself.
            
            You barely make it behind the layers of protection when the star collides into the roof.
            
            Even with all of your defenses, even with your eyes closed, protective goggles on, your hands over your eyes, and your head turned in the opposite direction, the blinding brightness pierces right through it all. The heat comes a split second later, much like if you had opened the door to a preheated oven and that oven happened to be powered by the sun.
            
            But as grand and intimidating the light and heat is, it lasts for only a fraction of a second before you’re left gasping in a cool, still, and overwhelmingly typical spring night.
            
            However, as cool and still the air around you feels, there very clearly is another presence on the roof with you, one that emits an aura of incredible thrumming energy and power.
            
            You’d never thought you’d be nervous to look at your catch, but you find yourself procrastinating on the corner of the roof, telling yourself that maybe you should wait another couple minutes, you know, to make sure the star is truly safe to approach.
            
            But at some point, a few millennia or so later, you realize you can't exactly leave a fallen star lying haplessly on top of a crappy apartment building forever. 
            
            That, and every book you've ever read on star hunting had said that this is not the time to be a wimp, because the quality (and more importantly to you, the asking price) of the material to be harvested plummets by the minute. Maybe the awe of shooting down a real life star made you momentarily forget that you‘re broke.
            
            Using the fear of not making rent again to brace yourself, you clench your fists and peek around the shelter. While there’s a few scorch marks burnt across the rooftop, like someone had taken to scraping charcoal across the concrete, everything is relatively intact. You breathe a sigh of relief when Nova appears untouched. And though the star itself is definitely still glowing, light leaking out between slightly crispy heat shields, the brightness is more tolerable.
            
            You shut your eyes and march over to the star before you can lose your nerve again, moving into the center of the ring. You’re not sure how long you stand there, blind and refusing to breathe out of fear, but it’s not until you’re about to asphyxiate that you decide to inhale.
            
            You also crack open your eyelids the tiniest bit, but it doesn’t do much good; all you see is a golden blur. Oh, how your aunt would be giggling at you now, refusing to look at a star like an elementary-schooler spurning every classmate of the opposite sex.
            
            So you finally open your eyes and lo and behold, it’s a blob. A very shimmery, luminous blob, sure, but still a blob.
            
            Perhaps there are, uh, more elegant ways to describe a fallen star, but you start to think all those sonnets and romance novels have led you astray, because the thing at your feet very much does not resemble steadfast points of heavenly splendor that watch lovingly over the earth.
            
            You shrug. Sure, this wasn’t quite what you were imagining, but this is definitely less intimidating than trying to harvest something so beautiful that its inspired humanity to wax poetic about it since the dawn of civilization.
            
            You run back across the rooftop to grab your supplies, returning to kneel by the amorphous pile of light with a handful of specially made empyrean glass vials and what is definitely a super state-of-the-art star harvesting device and definitely not your only clean soup spoon. 
            
            You manage to top off two vials worth of stardust, and one and a quarter of starfire before the star begins to leak rays of light, beams poking out through the surface and streaming up into the air.
            
            You throw your hands up over your face as the star explodes into the purest white light you’ve ever had the pleasure of unwittingly viewing, drowning the area in unadulterated illumination.
            
            You don’t know how long it takes for you to blink the stars (the other kind) out of your eyes, but when you do, your heart again decides this is a good time to develop arrhythmia. 
            
            Because laying in the place of what had been a blob, is now what appears to be vaguely human form. Vaguely, because you’re pretty sure no human is quite this undeniably and unequivocally beautiful. The word angel feels more fitting; the face you’re looking at is so perfect that it’s alien in appearance, ethereal in quality. Molten sun-gold eyes, hair that dances with an internal glow, skin perfectly smooth and bright and youthful. Every line, curve, edge is one of grace and elegance, a piece of art in perfect harmony. And the warmth that radiates off the star is like no other, as if the early morning summer sunlight had taken you into a loving embrace.
            
            You’re suddenly realizing that maybe those poems and novels were onto something, because no combination of words you could string together in normal conversation that would even come close to describing the star that laid in front of you. Adjectives like hot or pretty or handsome felt too crude, too...earthly. This was something more, a genderless, sexless beauty that just simply was.
            
            The only flaw in the sublime being that you couldn’t stop staring at is the fact that is seems to be missing its lower left arm, the image of it flickering in and out like a projector with a dying bulb.
            
            You look at your vials and are suddenly shot through with a deep shame. You clutch them in your hands sheepishly.
            
            No wonder stardust and starfire was so incredibly valued. It wasn’t just that shooting down stars was rare, no. It was this, staring into those captivating, resplendent eyes, and having the audacity to continue chopping pieces off and cramming them into your vials.
            
            You don’t know how long you and the star stare at each other, you increasingly flustered, the star calm, gentle, if a little disappointed in that you harvested one of its limbs.
            
            And then you hear it.
            
            Its mouth doesn’t move, its gaze doesn’t break. There is no voice that forms those words, only a gentle melody, a firm notion being pressed into your mind, a seashell into soft sand. It does not speak, but simple, clear request reverberates in your head all the same.
            
            Stop.
            
            You feel like you’re going to pass out.
            
            And then, making good on that feeling, you do, vision going dark, crumpling in at the edges. You flail backwards and end up in much the same position as you did when first caught the star: flat on your back, face up towards an expansive night sky.
            
            Only this time, the glittering stars are not billions of miles away. Rather, there’s one right next to you, looking at you with just a hint of concern in its beautiful, golden eyes.
            
            And though you’re about sixty percent sure you’ll wake up at some point, on the off chance that this is it, you figure there are worse things to see in the moments before eternal sleep.</p>
