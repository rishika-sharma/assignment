  <p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i><u><b>Cake</b></u></i></span> is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar,
       and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In 
       their oldest forms, cakes were modifications of
        bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of 
        preparations that can be simple or elaborate, and 
        that share features with other desserts such as 
        <span class="s2">pastries, meringues, custards, and pies.</span></p>

    <p class="p2">The most commonly used cake ingredients include 
        <span class="s3">flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, 
            a liquid, and leavening agents, such as baking 
            soda or baking powder.</span> Common additional 
        ingredients and flavourings include <span class="s4">
            dried, 
        candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts
         such as vanilla
        </span>, with numerous substitutions for
          the primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled
           with <span class="s5">fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces
            (like pastry cream), iced with buttercream or 
            other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped 
            borders, or candied fruit.</span></p>
    
    <p class="p3"><i>Cake</i> is often served as a celebratory dish on 
        ceremonial occasions, such as <span class="s1">weddings, 
            anniversaries, and birthdays.</span> There are countless
         cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich
          and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Cake 
          making is no longer a complicated procedure;
           while at one time considerable labor went into
            cake making (particularly the whisking of egg
             foams), baking equipment and directions have
              been simplified so that even the most amateur
              of cooks may bake a cake.</p>
<h3>The right to food is a human right derived from the
     <span><i><u>International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
        Cultural Rights (ICESCR) </u></i></span> , recognizing the "right to
      an adequate standard of living, including adequate
       food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free
        from hunger".</h3>
