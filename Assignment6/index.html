            When the bulb on its back grows <br> large,

              stand on its hind legs.

                 things. When it rains, steam
                  is <br> said to spout from the tip of its tail.

            It has a barbaric nature. In battle, <br>

              slashes away with sharp claws.

            Wartortle </a><br>
            Its tail is large and covered with<br> a rich,
             thick fur. The tailbecomes<br> increasingly 
              deeper in color as <br> Wartortle ages.
         The scratches on its <br> shell are evidence
          of this Pok√©mon's <br> toughness as a battler.
