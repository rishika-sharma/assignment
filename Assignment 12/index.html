            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>Coding means using the programming language to get the computer
                 to behave as desired. Each line of the code is a <span class="s1"><i>set of instructions</i></span>
                  for the computer. A set of codes form a script, and a set or
                   dozens of sets, form a <span class="s2"><i><b> HTML</b></i></span> is a coding language.
                    In fact, HTML stands for <span class="s3"><i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>.</span>
                     While <span class="s4"><b>HTML and CSS</b></span> are declarative, most coding is computational -
                      and it's what most other coding languages are designed for.</p>

            <h3>Computer</h3>
            <p>A <span class="s5"><i>computer is a machine</i></span> that accepts data as input, processes that data
            using programs, and outputs the processed data as information.
             Many computers can store and retrieve information using hard drives.
            Computers can be connected together to form <span class="s6"><b>networks</b></span>, allowing
              connected computers to communicate with each other.
