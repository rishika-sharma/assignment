    <h2>Etymology</h2>


    <p>
        According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009),the name "India" is derived from the Classical Latin India,a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India; ancient Greek Indos;Old Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus river and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi,which translates as "The people of the Indus".
