        <h1 class="ca">Captain America</h1>
        <p>Captain America is a superhero appearing in 
      American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
      Created by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack
         Kirby, the character first appeared in
        Captain America Comics #1 (cover dated 
     March 1941) from Timely Comics, a
      predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain
     America was designed as a patriotic
     supersoldier who often fought the Axis
         powers of World War II and was Timely
         Comics' most popular character during the wartime
    period. The popularity of superheroes waned following
     the war, and the Captain America comic book was
      discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival 
      in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character
 in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.</p>
